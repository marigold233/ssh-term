## Features

- **Connection Management** — Add, edit, and delete SSH connections from a central dashboard with a sortable table view
- **Interactive Terminal** — Full-screen SSH terminal emulation powered by [pyte](https://pyte.readthedocs.io/) with xterm-256color support, cursor rendering, and automatic terminal resizing
- **Dual-Pane File Transfer** — Side-by-side local and remote filesystem browser via SFTP with progress bar for uploads and downloads
- **Encrypted Password Storage** — Master password hashed with bcrypt (480k iterations). SSH passwords encrypted with Fernet, using a PBKDF2-derived key (SHA-256, 480k iterations) from the master password
- **Multiple Themes** — Six built-in dark color schemes for the UI, switchable with `T` on the dashboard. The terminal emulator always uses a fixed Tokyo Night background for consistent rendering. Theme choice is saved to config
- **Multiple Auth Methods** — SSH key, password, or SSH agent authentication
- **Lazy-Loading Remote Tree** — Remote directories are only fetched when expanded, keeping the UI responsive on large filesystems
- **Persistent Configuration** — All connections stored in a single JSON file, easy to back up or migrate

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) (recommended) or pip

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/babafish12/ssh-term.git
cd ssh-term
pipx install .
```

This installs `ssh-term` globally in an isolated virtual environment managed by pipx. The `ssh-term` command will be available system-wide at `~/.local/bin/ssh-term`.

### Updating

```bash
cd ssh-term
git pull
pipx install . --force
```

### Uninstalling

```bash
pipx uninstall ssh-term
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative: install in a virtual environment (for development)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/babafish12/ssh-term.git
cd ssh-term
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

</details>

---

## Quick Start

```bash
ssh-term
```

### 1. Set a Master Password

On first launch you'll be prompted to create a master password. You need to enter it twice for confirmation. This password:

- Is hashed with **bcrypt** and stored in the config file (never in plaintext)
- Derives an encryption key via **PBKDF2** (SHA-256, 480k iterations) used to encrypt/decrypt any saved SSH passwords
- Is required on every startup to unlock the application

### 2. Add a Connection

Press `a` on the dashboard to open the Add Connection form:

| Field              | Required | Description                                      |
|--------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**           | Yes      | Display name shown in the dashboard table        |
| **IP**             | Yes      | Hostname or IP address of the SSH server         |
| **Port**           | No       | SSH port (default: `22`)                         |
| **Username**       | Yes      | SSH login username                               |
| **Auth Method**    | Yes      | `SSH Key`, `Password`, or `SSH Agent`            |
| **Private Key Path** | No     | Path to private key (default: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`). Only used with SSH Key auth |
| **Password**       | No       | SSH password, stored encrypted with Fernet. Only used with Password auth |
| **Tags**           | No       | Comma-separated labels for organization (e.g. `prod, web, db`) |

Connections are saved immediately to `~/.config/ssh-term/config.json`.

### 3. Connect

Navigate connections with `Up`/`Down` arrow keys, then press `Enter` or click a row to connect. A full-screen interactive SSH terminal opens with:

- 256-color rendering
- Cursor display
- Automatic terminal resize (syncs pyte screen + remote PTY)
- Support for function keys (F1-F12), arrow keys, Home/End, PageUp/PageDown, Insert, Delete
- A status bar at the bottom showing the connection name, host, and available shortcuts

### 4. File Transfer

Press `f` on the dashboard (connects automatically if needed) or `Ctrl+F` inside an active terminal session to open the dual-pane file browser:

- **Left pane:** Local filesystem (starts at `$HOME`)
- **Right pane:** Remote filesystem via SFTP (lazy-loaded, starts at remote home directory)
- **Upload:** Select a file in the local pane, press `c` — file is uploaded to the remote working directory
- **Download:** Switch to the remote pane with `Tab`, select a file, press `c` — file is downloaded to `~/Downloads/`
- A **progress bar** at the bottom shows transfer status with filename and progress percentage

---

## Themes

The UI supports six built-in dark color schemes. Press `T` (Shift+T) on the dashboard to cycle through themes. The selected theme is saved to the config file and restored on next launch.

All UI elements (dashboard, forms, dialogs, status bars, file transfer) adapt to the selected theme. The **terminal emulator** always uses a fixed Tokyo Night background and ANSI color palette, regardless of the UI theme. This ensures consistent rendering of terminal output across all themes.

### Available Themes

| Theme              | Primary    | Background |
|--------------------|------------|------------|
| **Tokyo Night**    | `#7aa2f7`  | `#1a1b26`  |
| **Catppuccin Mocha** | `#89b4fa` | `#1e1e2e`  |
| **Dracula**        | `#bd93f9`  | `#282a36`  |
| **Nord**           | `#88c0d0`  | `#2e3440`  |
| **Gruvbox Dark**   | `#83a598`  | `#282828`  |
| **One Dark**       | `#61afef`  | `#282c34`  |

Each theme includes a complete color set (primary, secondary, accent, warning, error, success) and a matching 16-color ANSI palette for the terminal emulator.

## Configuration

All data is stored in a single JSON file:

```
~/.config/ssh-term/config.json
```

The directory is created automatically on first run. Example structure:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "master_password_hash": "$2b$12$...",
  "salt": "base64-encoded-16-byte-salt",
  "theme": "tokyo-night",
  "connections": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-v4",
      "name": "Prod Server",
      "host": "192.168.1.50",
      "ip": "",
      "port": 22,
      "username": "deploy",
      "auth_method": "key",
      "private_key_path": "~/.ssh/id_ed25519",
      "password_encrypted": "",
      "tags": ["prod", "web"],
      "color_label": "blue",
      "last_connected": "2026-03-09T14:30:00.000000"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Security Details

| Component         | Algorithm                          | Details                           |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Master password   | bcrypt                             | Salted hash, stored in config     |
| Encryption key    | PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256                 | 480,000 iterations, 16-byte salt  |
| SSH passwords     | Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) | Encrypted with derived key        |

The master password is **never** stored in plaintext. SSH passwords are only decryptable with the correct master password.

### Backup & Migration

To back up or migrate your connections, simply copy `~/.config/ssh-term/config.json`. Note that encrypted passwords can only be decrypted with the same master password.

## Troubleshooting

### `ssh-term` command not found after pipx install

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Add this line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` to make it permanent.

### Connection fails with "No such file" for SSH key

The default key path is `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. If you use a different key type, update the **Private Key Path** field when adding the connection (e.g. `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

### Terminal rendering looks wrong

Make sure your terminal emulator supports 256 colors. The SSH session uses `xterm-256color` as the terminal type.

### Forgot master password

There is no password recovery. Delete `~/.config/ssh-term/config.json` and start fresh. All saved connections and encrypted passwords will be lost.
